User Authentication:

Implement a login system to restrict access to authorized users only.


1. User Registration
- **Purpose**: Allow new users to create an account.
- **Components**:
  - Registration form (Username, Password, Email).
  - Validation checks (e.g., strong password criteria).
  - Securely store user credentials.
 Steps:
- **Create a Registration Form**: Design a form to collect user information.
- **Validate Input**: Ensure the entered data meets the required criteria (e.g., password length, special characters).
- **Hash Password**: Use a hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) to hash the user's password before storing it in the database.
- **Store User Information**: Save the user's details, including the hashed password, in a secure database.


 2. User Login
- **Purpose**: Allow existing users to log in.
- **Components**:
  - Login form (Username, Password).
  - Authentication process.
 Steps:
- **Create a Login Form**: Design a form to collect the username and password.
- **Retrieve User Data**: Fetch the user's stored credentials from the database.
- **Verify Password**: Compare the entered password with the stored hashed password using a hashing algorithm.
- **Session Management**: If the credentials are correct, create a session for the user.



 3. Password Recovery
- **Purpose**: Allow users to reset their password if they forget it.
- **Components**:
  - Password recovery form (Email).
  - Email service for sending reset links.
  - Secure token generation for resetting the password.
 Steps:
- **Create a Password Recovery Form**: Design a form to collect the user's email.
- **Generate Reset Token**: Create a unique, time-limited token for the password reset process.
- **Send Reset Link**: Email the reset link, containing the token, to the user.
- **Verify Token**: When the user clicks the link, verify the token's validity.
- **Allow Password Reset**: Let the user enter a new password, hash it, and update the database.



4. Security Measures
- **Purpose**: Enhance the security of the authentication system.
- **Components**:
  - Secure communication (e.g., HTTPS).
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA).
  - Account lockout after multiple failed attempts.
 Steps:
- **Enable HTTPS**: Ensure all communication between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS.
- **Implement MFA**: Add an extra layer of security by requiring a secondary form of authentication (e.g., SMS code, authenticator app).
- **Account Lockout**: Temporarily lock the account after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
